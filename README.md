# Predicting_Survival_in-the_ICU
This project applies machine learning to real-world healthcare data from ICU patients (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, PhysioNet). The goal is to build classification models that can predict in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality using features extracted from patient records.
